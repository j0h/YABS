/**
 * This file contains the Authentication active Method to the Campus and L2P System. There are two methods:
 *
 * First the Client OAuth. We actively ask for a token that the users needs to confirm.
 * Second the "standard" OAuth way. L2P gives us a token when a user wants to enter a room. (look at passive.js)
